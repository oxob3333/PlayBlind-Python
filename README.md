# Balatro: Python Edition!

Welcome to Balatro: Python Edition repository! 

Based on this post in reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1c1o5s9/balatro_java_edition/, i challenged myself "If this guy implemented the basics for balatro in java, why not in Python too?" So i just did

I readed the entire code made in java (that you can actually read it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AnF2IQD8lKeR2okXxIeybpmlR1kMrSFj/view) made by u/
Grassblox311


But that's not all, i implemented antes, rounds, a simple shop with currency, small/big/boss blinds with different effects for boss blinds and card enhancements!

Obviously this is not perfect, as i'm doing this for fun, so optimizations of code and etc is not the best (maybe the worst? idk) so, if you wanna implement some thing and do some pull requests i'm happy to see it!
